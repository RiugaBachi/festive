The great truth is there isn't one<br/>
And it only gets worse since that conclusion<br/>
The irony of being an extension to nothing<br/>
The force of inertia now a vital factor<br/>
<br/>
There is despair underneath each and every action<br/>
Burning bridges becomes a habit to support<br/>
And the front line expands like there's no tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be the misery, the filth, the discord and the horror<br/>
For these ones didn't need any outside source<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be the lies, the guilt, the fear, the woe and the betrayal<br/>
For these ones come from within<br/>
<br/>
Stratigraphy of rock bottom<br/>
The layers aplenty<br/>
As above, so below<br/>
But mostly below<br/>
<br/>
I envy the maggots<br/>
Their stuff at least sticks together<br/>
Better than laudations of misinformed seers<br/>
For those are the lengthy annals of shame we work with<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be the woodworkers<br/>
The crosses<br/>
And the gallows<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be the forgers of iron<br/>
And the spikes<br/>
And the barbed wire<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be the stone cutters<br/>
It took a quarry<br/>
To bury the dreams<br/>
<br/>
With every dream<br/>
The pyres grow taller<br/>
Stray philanthrope<br/>
In vain endeavor<br/>
Walk this path<br/>
Now and forever<br/>
<br/>
